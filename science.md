#### Languages

Java
- Developed by **Sun Microsystems**
- Uses **applets**
- **Statically** typed
- Uses the **Java Virtual Machine** (JVM)
  - This allows Java code to be run on many platforms
- A **compiled** language
- **Automatically** allocates memory for the user
- Uses a **garbage collector** to free up memory
- An **object-oriented** language
- An **imperative** language
  - Some **functional** support in Java is coming out, so this point may be invalidated in the future

C
- Developed by **Dennis Ritchie**
- **Statically** typed
- A **compiled** language
- A **compiled** language
- User must **manually** allocate memory
  - Using the **malloc** command
- **Not** an object-oriented language
- An **imperative language**

C++
- Effectively an extension of C
- An **object-oriented** language

Python
- Developed by **Guido van Rossum**
- **Dynamically** typed
- **Does not** require semicolons at the end of lines
- An **imperative** language, although lots of functional support exists
- **Not** an object-oriented language
- Popular libraries include:
  - Numpy
  - Pandas
  - Urllib
